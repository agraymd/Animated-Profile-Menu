This "Animated Profile Menu" is an element that contains a picture with a button underneath. 

When you click the button the menu expands 4 links with a pretty animation. Click again to close. 

Tested in FF, Safari, Chrome, Edge, Chrome on mobile. Let me know if you find any issues across browsers please :)

Recommended picture size is 370px X 416px. Replace ' # ' from

          <img id="profilePicture" class="avatar" src="#" alt="Your Name Portrait" height="416" width="370" >

in animatedProfileMenu.html to add your own picture.
